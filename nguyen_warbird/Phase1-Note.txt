Phase 1

warbird phase 1 design and Implementation Notes

The project has 2 classes: the Main Class, and the Model 3D Class.
The Model 3D classes have 3 files: Shade3D.hpp for planets, Ship3D.hpp for ship, and Missile3D for missile.
The Main Class- WarBird has many model 3d objects - 7 objects which are 5 planets objects, 1 ship object, and 1 missile object.
The initial design was to view all the objects in 3d Models. Each model has different size, rotation, and translation. 
There are different tri files for each objects - "ruber.tri", "unum.tri", "duo.tri", "primus.tri", "secundus.tri", "spaceship.tri", and "missile.tri".
The planets have the same number of vertices, but the ship and missile have different vertices, so they are treated differently.
The models are tranlsated from a set location. 
The sun is tranlsated from the origin and the moons are tranlsated from the planet they orbit.

The camera views for 2 planets are not dynamic. They don't follow the planets. 

There is a additional feature that added in the first phase. It is the camera of spaceship.
